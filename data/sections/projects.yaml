- name: Senior Design Project - Ecomspaces - Warehouse Workflow Optimization 
  #logo: /images/sections/projects/kubernetes.png
  role: Team Lead 
  #timeline: "March 2018 - Present"
  #repo: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  url: "https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/egr_srdsn/59/"  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: Provided consultation and analysis for Ecomspaces to  improve productivity, optimize the workflow by standardizing safety and maintenance procedures, and create benchmarks for the current state of the operation for continuous improvement purposes. Implemented DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) model, conducted time study, simulated in ARENA simulation software and constructed 40 different scenarios, performed audits (OSHA, Maintenance, Fire Safety, and Lighting), proposed 3 different layouts and performed TOPSIS analysis, performed Economic and Cost analysis, analyzed data in Python, and constructed KPI, SOPs, CTQ, Control Chart, Spaghetti Diagram, Cause and Effect Diagram, and Pareto Chart. Results - reduced 56.81% of the initial clutter and waste within the facility that results of 10.15% of overall improvement in the workflow warehouse.

  summary: A presentation about my Fall 2021 Co-op working as an IT OPS Digitalization Co-op at Boehringer Ingelheim. There were three projects I worked on during my co-op employment. The first project was the customer metrics. I collaborated with IT OPS team to construct a single command button that has a similar function to the multiple command functions that have been developed and optimized the developed code to reduce the time needed to compile all the information. The second project was the lab occupancy. I collaborated with IT team to construct a digital software/tool that allows users to identify whether a designated person/group is in the lab area, replacing the existing magnetic board. The third project was the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) Gainesville. I collaborated with IT, Business Process, and Automation team to conduct digital maturity assessment (DMA) to define equipment list, business scope, and EQM Quality. We utilized DMA to identify potential solutions to optimize current OEE calculations.

  summary: A presentation about my Summer 2021 Internship working as a BaSE Procurement Intern at United Parcel Service (UPS). There were two main projects and several side projects I worked on during my internship employment. The first project was the CBRE - Day 1 & spend plant engineering (PE) outside of IFM (Integrated Facility Management) Monthly. I gathered monthly data from MS SQL Server and performed data analysis in Pivot Tables. Then, I optimized the data utilizing VBA Excel Macros and visualized big data in Power BI. The second project was the Incumbent Canada vendors list. I collaborated with the UPS procurement team to conduct audits with 396 vendors. The purpose of this audit was to identify whether any contracts exist within UPS and the organization. The side projects include K9 Program Cost Savings, RecycleSmart, Welding Gas Analysis, and Lean Six Sigma Presentation.

  summary: Conducted Design of Experiment (DOE) by utilizing paper boat to identify and analyze how to increase the sinking time when a ship is planning to sink by at least 10%. This experiment involved 5 replications for each factor, 40 total paper boats, and utilized Minitab to analyze data by constructing Main Effects and Interaction Effects Plots, Residual Plots, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

  summary: A presentation about my Fall 2020 Co-op working as a Sourcing/Purchasing at Boehringer Ingelheim. There were three projects I worked on during my co-op employment. The first project was the non-sterile oral liquids suspension. I gathered, identified, and contacted all the potential suppliers to obtain pricing quotes from those who are interested in pursuing the opportunity and utilized quotes to conduct market research and select the contract manufacturing organization (CMO). The second project was the supplier database. I created a software database using VBA Excel Macros to store all the information about potential suppliers to gather information for future projects/opportunities quickly and efficiently. The third project was the sterile liquid market research. I gathered and compiled a list of potential suppliers capable of manufacturing sterile injectables for animal health products in bulk size.
